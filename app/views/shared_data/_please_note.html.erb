    <li><p class='projectExplanation'>Project data are available in the <i>live</i> AACT database hosted at aact-db.ctti-clinicaltrials.org. Static copies of the database and pipe-delimited filesets available for download contain only ClinicalTrials.gov data; they do not include project information.</p></li>
    <li><p class='projectExplanation'>Files containing data element definitions (defining project-specific tables & columns) are available for download for some projects in the 'Other Attachments' section.</p></li>
    <li><p class='projectExplanation'> Currently, AACT includes analytic information for four AACT-based projects that CTTI determined will likely benefit the largest audience. Many other investigators have analyzed ClinicalTrials.gov data. CTTI intends to continue to add curated & analytic data from past and future research to further enhance this resource.</p></li>
