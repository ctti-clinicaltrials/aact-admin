  <h2>AACT Views & Functions</h2>

  <p>Database views & functions have been provided to facilitate data retrieval. These features are described below. The first table identifies a set of views that provide concatenate sets of values per study. These views are useful for people who need to generate a spreadsheet that contains one row per study and would like to include info for which studies often have multiple values, such as conditions. For example, if you need a comma-separated list of the conditions associated with a study, you may get that from the all_conditions view. These views are in the ctgov schema; all include 2 columns: NCT_ID & Names. </p>
  <p>Here is a sample query:</p>

  <pre>
    <p class='code'>
      <span class='command-prompt'>aact=# </span><span class='command-entry'>select * from ctgov.all_conditions where nct_id='NCT00000146';</span>
    </p>
  </pre>
