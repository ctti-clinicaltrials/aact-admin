  <h1>Researcher's Guide to Using Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) Database</h1>

<section class="pointsToConsider">

  <h2>What is AACT?</h2>

  <div class="info-box">
    <p class='ptc'>
      The Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) is a PostgreSQL relational database that contains detailed information from clinical studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.

      AACT includes all publicly available protocol and results data elements from ClinicalTrials.gov. Data are downloaded daily and loaded into the AACT database to ensure it stays current.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>What population of studies is represented in AACT?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    AACT includes all studies that are registered and publicly available on ClinicalTrials.gov. The registry has accepted studies since <b>February 29, 2000</b>, covering both interventional and observational research.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    ClinicalTrials.gov includes:
  </p>

  <ul class='regularDisplay'>
    <li><b>Interventional studies</b>, where participants are assigned to specific interventions under a research protocol.</li>
    <li><b>Observational studies</b> that monitor outcomes without assigned interventions.</li>
    <li><b>Expanded Access records</b>, describing how patients can obtain experimental drugs or devices when standard treatments are unavailable, and they cannot participate in clinical trials.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class='ptc'>
    Registration and results reporting have become increasingly mandatory due to legal, institutional, and publication requirements. Key drivers include the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
    (<a target='_blank' href='http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/' onClick="ga('send','event','external link','guide page: ICMJE')">ICMJE</a>), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These policies define which studies must register and report results in ClinicalTrials.gov.

    * Adapted from 
    <a class='ptcFootNote' target='_blank' href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012065#t=article">The ClinicalTrials.gov results database – update and key issues</a> and 
    <a class='ptcFootNote' target='_blank' href='https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site/history'>ClinicalTrials.gov summary of selected events, policies, and laws related to the development and expansion of ClinicalTrials.gov</a>. For complete descriptions of policy requirements, see the references cited. EMA = European Medicines Agency; EU = European Union; FDAAA = Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act; ICMJE = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors; IDE = investigational device exemption; IND = investigational new drug application; NCI = National Cancer Institute; NIH = National Institutes of Health; US = United States.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    Based on these policies, the following factors influence the likelihood that a study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (and therefore included in AACT):
  </p>

  <ul class='regularDisplay'>
    <li>Interventional studies are more likely to be registered than observational studies.</li>
    <li>Studies begun before the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/'>ICMJE</a> requirement in <b>July, 2005</b> are less likely to be registered, especially if results remain unpublished (e.g., negative results).</li>
    <li>Studies involving drugs, biologics, or devices are more likely to be registered than those involving other types of interventions.</li>
    <li>Studies with at least one site in the United States or European Union are more likely to be registered.</li>
    <li>Studies involving a drug or device manufactured in the United States are more likely to be registered.</li>
    <li>Studies subject to an IND or IDE are more likely to be registered, especially if intended to support US marketing approval.</li>
    <li>Phase 1 adult drug studies and small feasibility studies of devices are less likely to be registered.</li>
    <li>Pediatric studies may be more likely to be registered.</li>
    <li>NIH-funded studies are generally registered, regardless of intervention type or phase.</li>
    <li>FDA-regulated device studies are usually registered, though records for unapproved devices may remain unpublished until after approval.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Is the information in AACT up-to-date?</h2>
  <div class="gray-box">
    <p class='ptc'>
      The AACT database updates every night at midnight, making it typically one day behind ClinicalTrials.gov.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      Each night:
    </p>

    <ul class='regularDisplay'>
      <li>The ClinicalTrials.gov RSS feed identifies studies added or changed the previous day.</li>
      <li>The ClinicalTrials.gov API retrieves data for only those new or updated studies.</li>
      <li>Only new or modified studies are inserted or updated in AACT.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='ptc'>
      This nightly process takes about 1.5 hours, depending on the number of changes.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      Occasionally, studies are removed from ClinicalTrials.gov (for example, duplicate records). Because nightly updates don’t detect removals, AACT is completely refreshed once per month to stay in sync.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      Both nightly (incremental) and monthly (full) updates run on a background copy of the database so the public version remains available during processing. After updates complete, the refreshed database replaces the public version in a copy step that takes about 5 minutes. Because nightly updates begin at midnight, this brief downtime usually occurs between 1:00 am and 2:00 am.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      Please refer to the posted <a target='_blank' href='/update_policy'>update schedule</a> for more details.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>How are unique studies identified in AACT?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    Each study registered in ClinicalTrials.gov has a unique identifier called the <code>NCT_ID</code>.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    Because ClinicalTrials.gov applies quality assurance checks during registration, each <code>NCT_ID</code> generally represents a distinct clinical study. However, a small number of 
    <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17507347'>duplicate records may exist in the database</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How does content in AACT compare to what is in ClinicalTrials.gov?</h2>

  <div class="info-box">
    <p class='ptc'>
      AACT contains all protocol and results data for every study publicly available on ClinicalTrials.gov. It includes the full current record for each study exactly as it appears in ClinicalTrials.gov.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      The database preserves the original XML content downloaded via the ClinicalTrials.gov API without cleaning or manipulation. However, to aid queries, AACT also includes derived variables in the <code>Calculated_Values</code> table.
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>
      Note that the history of changes to study records (available on the ClinicalTrials.gov archive site) is not included in AACT.
    </p>
  </div>


  <h2>What types of questions can be investigated using ClinicalTrials.gov data?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    The AACT database includes both study protocol and results data elements.
    Protocol records describe study details such as sponsor, disease condition, intervention type, participant eligibility, enrollment targets, study design, locations, and outcome measures.
    Summary results cover participant flow, baseline characteristics, outcomes, and frequencies of serious and other adverse events.
    The <a target='_blank' href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821287/'>article by Tse et al.</a> provides a helpful overview of the basic results reported at ClinicalTrials.gov.
  </p>

  <h2>How can protocol/registration data be used?</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p class='ptc'>
      Investigators can use the database to explore characteristics of specific clinical study subsets (e.g., typical enrollment in phase 3 breast cancer studies) and to compare these characteristics across subgroups (e.g., sponsor type, device versus drug interventions, or prevention versus treatment).
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>How can results and adverse events data be used?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    Researchers can use results and adverse events data from ClinicalTrials.gov for meta-analyses or systematic reviews—for example, comparing the efficacy and safety of diabetes therapies.  
    However, since only a subset of registered studies are required to report results, ClinicalTrials.gov data is best used as a supplement to traditional sources like published and unpublished manuscripts.
    Standard guidelines such as the <a target='_blank' href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=744664">PRISMA statement</a> should guide how to identify and combine summary data from ClinicalTrials.gov and the literature.
  </p>

  <h2>How should data elements be interpreted?</h2>
  <div class="info-box">  
    <p class='ptc'>
      When interpreting AACT data, refer to the authoritative definitions from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The latest data element definitions are available on the NLM site for 
      <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html'>studies</a> and 
      <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/results_definitions.html'>results</a> data. Interpretation depends on:
    </p>

    <ul class='regularDisplay'>
      <li><b>How the question was phrased.</b> For example, “Sponsor” may not always mean the funding agency, differing from common usage.</li>
      <li><b>Whether responses are free-text or from fixed options.</b> Definitions and allowed responses may change over time. See the <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html'>latest study definitions</a>, <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/results_definitions.html'>results definitions</a>, and the <a target='_blank' href="http://ctti-clinicaltrials.org/files/documents/AACTcomprehensiveDataDictionaryV3_2011.xlsx" download>AACT 2011 Data Dictionary</a> for history. Monthly AACT releases include corresponding dictionaries and schema.</li>
      <li><b>Dependence between fields.</b> Some elements must be interpreted with related data—for example, enrollment and completion dates have companion fields indicating whether the value is anticipated or actual.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='note'>
      Note that study records can be updated by owners at any time. For example, enrollment type may change from anticipated to actual. Downloaded data reflects a static snapshot; history of changes is not preserved.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>How complete and accurate are the data?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    A record in a table means at least one element in that table was submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov before data download. Some elements are more likely to be missing than others, influenced by factors such as:
  </p>

  <ul class='regularDisplay'>
    <li><b>FDAAA and ClinicalTrials.gov requirements.</b> See NLM’s <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html'>study</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/results_definitions.html'>results</a> data definitions for details. Requirements have evolved over time.</li>
    <li><b>Date of element introduction.</b> Not all data elements existed at ClinicalTrials.gov launch in 2000; later studies must meet more requirements.</li>
    <li><b>Question branching.</b> Some questions depend on prior answers—for example, bio-specimen questions apply only to observational studies, so interventional studies should be excluded when analyzing those data.</li>
    <li><b>Answer options.</b> Data elements offering “N/A” responses often have fewer missing values.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class='ptc'>
    Missing data may also result from unknown factors. Users should clearly define how missing and “N/A” values are handled in analyses—for example, whether to exclude or impute missing data (e.g., a single-arm study cannot be randomized).
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    To reduce missing data, users might restrict analyses to studies registered after FDAAA (September 2007) or with primary completion dates after December 2007. Annotating elements by FDAAA requirement status may also be helpful.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    Even complete data elements should be interpreted cautiously. Results on ClinicalTrials.gov may lack the rigorous peer-review of published studies. As <a target='_blank' href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012065#t=article">Zarin et al.</a> explain, NLM applies automated and manual quality checks but cannot always verify accuracy against independent sources. Posting does not guarantee full compliance with ClinicalTrials.gov or legal requirements.<sup><a target='_blank' href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012065#t=article">[1]</a></sup>
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    In our analysis, extreme values (e.g., anticipated enrollment of millions) were found. Users should review data distributions, apply appropriate methods, and perform consistency checks (e.g., matching the number of arms described to the study design) before analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>Use of appropriate statistical inference</h2>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p class='ptc'>
      When using AACT results for meta-analyses or systematic reviews on intervention safety or efficacy, apply standard methods such as the <a target='_blank' href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=744664" onClick="ga('send','event','external link','guide page: PRISMA')">PRISMA statement</a> to properly account for variability and potential biases between studies. Authors should consider the following points before reporting p-values, confidence intervals, or other statistical inferences in aggregate analyses of ClinicalTrials.gov data:
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Is the data-generating mechanism random?</h2>
  <p class='ptc'>
    Statistical inference methods like p-values and 95% confidence intervals are appropriate when data arise from a random process, such as randomly selecting subjects or assigning treatments, where uncertainty about the population exists.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    We recommend against using p-values and confidence intervals when the data-generating mechanism is not random, as in the examples below:
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    <b>Example 1:</b> Descriptive analysis of studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. Here, the “sample” is the entire “population” of registered studies, so there is no uncertainty to quantify, making statistical inference unnecessary.
  </p>

  <p class='ptc'>
    <b>Example 2:</b> Descriptive analysis of the broader clinical trials enterprise based on registered studies. Some required studies may be unregistered, and this missingness is likely non-random. Thus, p-values and confidence intervals are not useful for extrapolating from registered studies to the entire clinical trials population. Instead, limit inference to studies highly likely to be registered (see section on Population) to minimize sample-to-population uncertainty.
  </p>

  <h2>How can I objectively identify important differences?</h2>
  <div class="info-box"> 
    <p class='ptc'>
      In practice, p-values and confidence intervals are often used even without a random data generating process to highlight differences that stand out from “noise” (e.g., p-value &lt; .001). Although this use lacks strong statistical grounding, many audiences (like peer reviewers) expect p-values as objective criteria for detecting notable signals. While we don’t recommend relying on p-values for this purpose, we encourage analysts to define clear, objective criteria for evaluating signals in the data. Examples include:
    </p>

    <p class='ptc'>a) Specify comparisons or quantities of interest before examining the data.</p>

    <p class='ptc'>b) Define the size of differences that are practically meaningful (e.g., a 25% difference in funding source between two pediatric <i>Conditions</i>, or a difference of 100 participants in enrollment).</p>

    <p class='ptc'>c) Choose formulas to quantify differences or summarize variability, considering observed differences, data variability, and sample size. Examples include:</p>

    <ul class='regularDisplay'>
      <li>Reporting median and 5th to 95th percentiles for continuous variables like enrollment.</li>
      <li>Calculating t-statistics or chi-squared statistics (without p-values) to rank group differences, with a pre-set threshold (e.g., absolute value of 3) to flag notable differences.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h2>Specific tips for working with the AACT database</h2>
  <ul class='regularDisplay'>
    <li>Users are encouraged to use the <a href='/schema' target="_blank" onClick="ga('send','event','download','guide page: download schema')">Schema Diagram</a> to determine relationships between different AACT tables. These relationships determine how tables may be linked using tools such as SAS, R & SQL.</li>
    <li>The <i>nct_id</i> uniquely identifies each study; it serves as the primary key in the <i>Studies</i> table. Each record in the <i>Studies</i> table has a unique <i>nct_id</i> value. <i>nct_id</i> also appears in every table related to <i>Studies</i> so that every record in every table can link back to the study to which it refers.</li>
    <li>Every table other than <i>Studies</i> has a primary key named <i>id</i>, which provides an integer that uniquely identifies each row in that table. (The <i>Studies</i> table uses <i>nct_id</i> instead of <i>id</i> as the unique identifier for each row.)</li>
    <li>To link table information to the study to which it refers, you simply match on <i>nct_id</i>. For example, every record in the <i>Conditions</i> table with an NCT_ID of ‘NCT0000001’ refers to the study with the NCT_ID: ‘NCT0000001’ (saved in <i>Studies.nct_id</i>). The <i>Conditions</i> table may contain multiple records with an NCT_ID of ‘NCT0000001’ which means this study was defined in ClinicalTrials.gov as being associated with the <i>Conditions</i> listed in <i>Conditions</i> with that NCT_ID.</li>
    <li>Information in several tables are also related to information in other tables. In this case, the table that belongs to another table will include a foreign key that identifies the record to which it belongs. Foreign keys are always named according to a simple rule: the singular name of the related table followed by: ‘_id’. For example, <i>Facility_Contacts</i> includes a data element: <i>facility_id</i> which is the foreign key to <i>Facilities.id</i>.</li>
    <li>Each record’s foreign_key (ie. <i>facility_id</i>) contains the value of the unique identifier (id) of the record in the other table to which it belongs. For example, a facility may have multiple contacts. To find the contacts for a particular facility, look for the records in <i>Facility_Contacts</i> where the value in <i>facility_id</i> is same as the value in id for that facility in <i>Facilities</i>. In short, tables are related to each other with this pattern: <i>child.&lt;parent_name&gt;_id = parent.id</i>.</li>
    <li>Note that the ID assigned to a particular record (e.g., to a record in the <i>Facilities</i> table) is merely the method used to identify unique records in the database table, and to facilitate linking of records between database tables. The ID does not identify unique facilities in the real world. For example, if studies A and B are both enrolling patients at Duke University Medical Center, there will be one instance of Duke University Medical Center for each study, and these records will have different ID values, even though they may be the same physical research site.</li>
