  <h3>MeSH Thesaurus</h3>
  <p>All ClinicalTrials.gov data are available in the <i>ctgov</i> schema of the AACT database.</p>

  <p>
    Clinicaltrials.gov assigns each study two sets of MeSH terms.
    Browse Conditions for conditions studied in the trial & Browse Interventions for interventions used in the trial.
    Earlier versions of the data did not include the full MeSH hierarchy, but studies now contain the full hierarchy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The column mesh_type indicates if the term is a leaf identified as “mesh-list” or an ancestor identified as “mesh-ancestor”.
  </p>

  <p>
    When data submitters provide information to ClinicalTrials.gov about a study, they’re encouraged to use Medical Subject Heading
    (<a target='_blank' href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html'>MeSH</a>) \
    terminology for interventions, conditions, and keywords. The <i>browse_conditions</i> and 
    <i>browse_interventions</i> tables contain MeSH terms generated by an algorithm run by NLM. 
    The NLM algorithm is re-run nightly on all studies in the ClinicalTrials.gov database, and sources the most up-to-date information in the study record, 
    the latest version of the algorithm, and the version of the MeSH thesaurus in use at that time.

    The National Library of Medicine updates the MeSH Thesaurus each year.
