    <h1>Download Archive AACT</h1>
       <p>
       The archived copies are available for download. These can be used to create a local copy of a particular instance of the database. A number of query and analytic tools (such as SAS, pgAdmin & R) can then be used to connect to and query your local copy.</p>
       <p>For those who prefer to access the data via simple flat files, static copies are also available as a zipped package of pipe-delimited files.<p>
